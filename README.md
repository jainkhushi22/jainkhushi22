## 🌱 About Me  

I’m an AI & Data Science student who likes to **understand things from the inside out**.  
Not just using models — building them.  
Not just analyzing data — questioning it.

I enjoy:
- Breaking problems into first principles  
- Building ML & LLM components **from scratch**  
- Turning notebooks into deployed, usable systems  

Learning. Building. Refactoring life one commit at a time.
